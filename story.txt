There once was a man named Doug. Doug had everything in life: a dog, a cat, and a car.
There was nothing more that Doug wanted than to degree from a school but it was basically impossible since all classes are online now.
Doug decided he was going to start his own business to rival companies like Apple and Nvidia. This...was a great idea for Doug.
