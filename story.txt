There once was a man named Doug. Doug had everything in life: a dog, a cat, and a car.
There was nothing more that Doug wanted than to degree from a school but it was basically impossible since all classes are online now.
Doug decided he was going to start his own business to rival companies like Apple and Nvidia. This...was a great idea for Doug.
But it turned out that starting a business was harder than Doug thought. 
His business was struggling, and he was spending all his time keeping it afloat.
Now Doug faced a difficult decision.
