There once was a man named Doug. Doug had everything in life: a dog, a cat, and a car.
There was nothing more that Doug wanted than to degree from a school but it was basically impossible since all classes are online now.
Doug decided he was going to start his own business to rival companies like Apple and Nvidia. This...was a great idea for Doug.
But it turned out that starting a business was harder than Doug thought. 
His business was struggling, and he was spending all his time keeping it afloat.
Now Doug faced a difficult decision.

Doug decided he would give up on starting his business and give online classes another try. Doug applied to the University of Wisconsin-Madison and was accepted into the School of Business. Since Doug was originally interested in starting a business in the technology field, he decided he would major in Computer Science, too. Doug bought himself a nice new Macbook pro and was ready to conquer the world of online classes. Little did Doug know that attending University of Wisconsin-Madison was very expensive. Now Doug is faced with a difficult financial decision.
